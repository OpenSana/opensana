OpenSana is an open-source platform designed to help governments and local health systems collect, analyze, and visualize public health data in regions with limited infrastructure.

## 🎯 Mission

We believe that access to health data should not be limited by geography or resources. OpenSana aims to bridge the gap between complex data analysis and real-world healthcare delivery in developing countries.

## 🛠️ Features

- Offline-first: Works without internet connection
- Lightweight: Runs on Raspberry Pi
- ETL automation: Powered by Apache Airflow
- Visualization: Dashboards via Dash/Pandas
- Integration-ready: Supports DHIS2, FHIR, OpenMRS
